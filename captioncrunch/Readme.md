**Caption Crunch** is a fun and interactive Discord game where users submit captions for an image, and then vote on the best one! The game is designed to be easy to set up and play, with rewards for the most creative captions.

- **Voting System**: After submissions are collected, users vote on their favorite caption.
- **Rewards**: Winners can earn in-game currency (if enabled by the server admin).
- **Leaderboard**: Track the top players based on their wins and winnings.
- **Customizable Settings**: Admins can configure various settings such as submission timeout, vote timeout, caption length limits, and more.
